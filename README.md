# Machine learning python
This repo is my attempt to do [*coursera machine learning*](https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/class/index) assignments in python using scipy and numpy.
My focus is not to submit the work in python but to implement the algorithms in python to learn more about using machine learning in python. I will be posting solutions to assigments only after the hard deadline is over. You can contact me at my github account.

## I will use following conventions in naming files.
*ex3.py* will correspond to ex3.m, which will be exercise 3 of coursera
*demo[3].py* will have my experiments while learning the course
